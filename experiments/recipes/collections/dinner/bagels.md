## Ingredients
- 4 tbsp honey
- 4g dry yeast
- 400g bread flour
- sesame seeds

## Instructions
1.  Mix 235ml warm water with 1 tbsp honey and the yeast, leave to bloom for ~5 minutes.

2. Add 1 tsp salt and 325g flour to start with, and begin to knead the dough. 
Knead in more flour until the dough will not absorb any more. Cover the dough and let rise until doubled in size (1-2 hours).

3. Divide the dough into 6 parts. 
roll each part out into a snake and make it into a circle around your wrist. 
To join the two ends of the snake, press down on the seam and roll it off. 
Line a baking tray with parchment paper, lightly dust with flour, and place the bagels. Finally, cover with cling film and keep in the fridge for 1-2 days.

4. Preheat the oven to 230Â°C. 
Bring a wide pot of water to a boil, add in 1 tbsp of honey per liter of water.
Boil the bagels in batches, 1 or 2 minutes per side. 
Put the bagels in upside down, so that after you flip them over to boil the other side, 
you can scoop them out onto the baking tray without flipping them again.
Sprinkle half of them with sesame seeds while they are still wet.
Once all bagels have been boiled, bake them in the oven for 20-25 minutes.
