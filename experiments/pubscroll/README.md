# Scrolling Through Publications Instead of Social Feeds
Mobile apps with infinite scroll are a great way to keep you watching cat videos.
Why not use that approach for something more productive, such as keeping up with publications in your field?

I want to put together a list of conferences/journals etc. that publish research close to my own work, and have a nice interface for me to flick through recent publications from my phone.
I also want to be able to mark publications as interesting so that I read them more carefully at a later time.
