# SKI Combinatory logic compiler and runtime for Core
This folder contains a compiler and corresponding to runtime for the Core language based on the S, K, and I combinators.
The implementation is based on the book [The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/1987/01/slpj-book-1987.pdf), 
with aspirations to eventually incorporate the ideas of [Lambda to SKI, Semantically](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/ski.pdf).
