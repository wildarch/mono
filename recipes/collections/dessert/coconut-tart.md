Serves at least 8.

## Ingredients
### Base
- 120g all-purpose flour
- 50g coconut flakes
- 100g sugar
- 110g virgin coconut oil
- 3g salt

### Ganache
- 240ml coconut cream or milk
- 170g dark chocolate
- 1 tbsp syrup

## Instructions
1. Heat the oven to 180C.
2. **Base:** Check that the coconut oil is solid at room temperature.
   If not, refrigerate before use.
   Mix flour, coconut flakes, sugar and salt.
   Cut in the coconut oil: 
   Press the solid chunks of coconut oil into the flour mixture, breaking them up into smaller coated chunks that do not stick to each other anymore. 
   Work it until you get a breadcrumb-like consistency.
3. Mold the base into a tart pan (I use a 23cm springform pan). You can make it a bit thinner in the edges because the rim will sink down during cooking.
   Bake for 15-25 minutes. Do not leave it for too long or the crust will become too hard to cut through.
   Leave to cool down completely before you add the ganache.
4. **Ganache:** Pour the milk/cream into a microwave-safe measuring jug.
   If you use a 400ml coconut milk can, try to mainly use the cream at the top.
5. Chop the chocolate and add to the jug.
   Microwave for 1-2 minutes, until the chocolate starts to melt.
   You will find that you do not have to fully melt it in the microwave: The residual heat will keep melting the chocolate after you have pulled it from the microwave.
6. Add syrup as needed to make it sweet enough to your liking.
   Pour the ganache over the base.
   Leave the tart in the fridge overnight.
   If saving it for longer, cover it after the first night to keep it from drying out too much.
7. Serve topped with flaky salt and more coconut flakes.
