## Ingredients
- 4 eggs
- 300g sugar
- 150g flour
- 3g salt
- 250g unsalted butter
- 250g chocolate

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180C (160C convection).
2. In a large bowl combine the eggs and sugar. 
   Whisk until smooth and the sugar has melted. 
   If you are using soft brown sugar, make sure there are no lumps. 
   If there are, then pass the mix through a sieve.
3. Add the flour and salt. Whisk until smooth.
   Combine the butter and the chocolate in a small pan or in a microwave safe dish. 
   Melt on medium heat on the cooker for around 5 minutes stirring occasionally. 
   It would take around 3 minutes on the highest setting in the microwave. 
   The mix does not need to be hot. 
   Just melt it until itâ€™s all smooth and that will be enough.
4. Pour the chocolate and butter mix into the egg, sugar, flour, and salt mix. 
   Whisk until completely combined.
5. Pour the brownie batter into a non-stick paper lined baking tray (should be around 20x25cm). 
   Whack it against the table a few times to get rid of any air bubbles
6. Bake for 35 minutes.
8. Leave to cool down completely. 
   Cutting a cold brownie is a lot easier and makes for neater pieces. 
   You can refrigerate it after cooling down. 


## Info
Recipe from [chainbaker](https://www.chainbaker.com/brownies/).

I use extra dark 74% cocoa chocolate, but any chocolate should work.
Brown sugar is ideal, but any kind of sugar will do.
