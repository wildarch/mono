## Ingredients
### Crust
- 250g ginger biscuits
- 3 tbsp flour
- 1.75 tbsp sugar
- 0.3 tsp salt
- 80g butter

### Cheese
- 300g cream cheese
- 70g sugar
- 125g sour cream
- 1 tbsp flour
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 lemon

### Berry topping
- 200g frozen blackberries
- 2 tbsp sugar

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 160C.

2. Fold the biscuits in a towel and bash them with a rolling pin until fine.
   Melt the butter.
   In a bowl, combine the ingredients for the crust, then push into the base and sides of an 18cm loose-bottomed cake tin.
   Bake in the middle of the oven for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.

   In a large mixing bowl, add all ingredients for the cheese and whisk until smooth.
   You want a heaped tablespoon of flour, both the zest and juice of the lemon, and a tiny pinch of salt to finish.
   Transfer to the baking tin.
   Bake in the middle of the oven for another 30-35 minutes, until set but with a wobble in the middle.

3. Once it goes in the oven, toss the blackberries in two tablespoons of sugar and spread out in a baking dish. Roast in same oven for last 20-25 minutes of cooking, from frozen. They should be deflated and juicy, but still hold their shape.

4. When the cheesecake has cooled, refrigerate for a few hours, then serve topped with the blackberries.
