![](https://www.rainbownourishments.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/easy-vegan-lemon-blueberry-cake-1.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 315g all-purpose flour
- 250g granulated sugar
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 190g dairy-free milk (such as almond milk)
- 125g neutral flavored oil
- 80g lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 190g blueberries (fresh or frozen)

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 
   Line a 20cm round cake tin with baking paper.

2. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder). Add a pinch of salt too.
   Mix the wet ingredients separately (milk, oil, lemon juice and zest, vanilla paste), then combine with the dry ingredients and mix again into a thick batter.

3. Fold half of the blueberries into the batter.
   Pour the batter into the lined cake pan. 
   Scatter the remaining blueberries on top, gently pressing them into the batter.
   The blueberries will tend to drift towards the center while baking, so place most of them towards the edge.

4. Bake for approximately 1 hour, or until you can stick a toothpick in the middle and pull it out without any wet batter on it. 
   Leave to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
