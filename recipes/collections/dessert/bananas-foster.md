Serves: 2.

## Ingredients
- 30g butter
- 40g brown sugar
- 1/6 tsp cinnamon
- ground nutmeg
- 1 ripe but firm banana (150g)
- 20ml rum or other liquor
- Vanille ice cream

## Instructions
1. Split the banana in half crosswise and then lengthwise.
2. In a small stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter with the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt salt while stirring and swirling, until mixture blends into a grainy liquid and begins to bubble, about 2 minutes.
3. Add bananas, cut side down, and continue to cook, swirling gently, until liquid begins to resemble a more smooth caramel, about 2 minutes longer.
4. Add rum (*do not pour directly from the bottle if working over an open flame*), then tilt pan to ignite the alcohol from a gas burner.
Cook, shaking the pan, until the flames have died out and the caramel has thickened to a honey consistency, about 1 to 2 minutes.
5. Flip bananas cut side up, then transfer to serving plates with ice cream.
