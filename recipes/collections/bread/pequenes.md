## Ingredients (Filling)
- 30 ml lard, vegetable shortening, or vegetable oil
- 750g white or yellow onions (about 4 medium onions), diced
- 1/2 tbsp Chilean aji de color or sweet (smoked) paprika
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 5 g salt
- 1 tbsp (15) Chilean hot sauce or sriracha (optional)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 120 ml beef or vegetable broth

## Ingredients (Dough)
- 60g g unsalted butter
- 60g g lard or vegetable shortening (or more unsalted butter)
- 5g salt
- 450g all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 180 ml hot water (55 to 60°C), divided
- 1 large egg, at room temperature and lightly beaten, divided
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) Chilean pisco (use Peruvian pisco or vodka if not available)

## Ingredients (To Assemble)
- 30 ml milk
- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoons milk to form an egg wash

## Instructions
1. **For the Pequenes Filling:** In a large nonstick pan or medium Dutch oven, heat lard over medium heat until melted and shimmering.
   Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and transparent, about 15 minutes.

2. Add ají de color, cumin, salt, hot sauce (if using), and freshly ground black pepper to taste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
   Using a wooden spoon, add flour into onion mixture and cook stirring frequently until no lumps remain, about 2 minutes.
   Stir in broth and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and onion mixture is almost dry, 10 to 20 minutes.
   Season with salt to taste.

3. Transfer onion mixture to bowl and let cool slightly, then refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.

4. **For the Empanada Dough:** In a small saucepan, melt butter and shortening over medium heat until hot (55 to 60°C).

5. In a big mixing bowl, thoroughly whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder.
   Make a well in center of flour mixture and add half of the hot water, half of the melted hot fat mixture, and half of the eggs.
   Using a wooden spoon, stir vigorously until combined and small lumps form.
   Add remaining water, fat mixture, eggs, and pisco and stir vigorously until rough dough ball forms and separates from the bowl.

6. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand until smooth, and still warm, about 3 minutes.

7. Wrap with with plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place for 15 minutes.

8. **To Assemble:** Before filling the pequenes, par-freeze onion filling until firm, 15 to 30 minutes.
  Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 245°C.

9. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces (125g each).

10. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time (keep remaining dough pieces covered and warm), dust dough piece lightly with flour and roll into a ball on a lightly floured work surface.
    Using a rolling pin, roll into a 24cm round.
    Do not worry if disc is not perfect; edges will be trimmed later.

11. Place 3 tablespoons (about 85g) cold onion filling in lower center half of dough round.
    Using pastry brush, lightly brush outer 2.5cm edge of dough round with milk.
    Fold dough over filling (without stretching the dough), pressing gently on the border to seal the edges.
    It should look like a half moon.
    Don’t worry if some air is trapped inside, as empanadas will be pricked before baking.

12. Using a pasta wheel or pizza cutter, trim excess dough to form a 2cm dough border.
    Lightly brush milk over sealed edge.
    Using your fingers, make 4 evenly spaced folds of the dough border inward towards the filling: 2 from the corners towards the sides of the empanada, and then 2 in the center.
    Folds should slightly overlap and form a V.
    Using your index finger, press firmly in the corners where foldings meet.
    Repeat with remaining dough pieces and filling.

13. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
    Arrange the pequenes on the prepared sheets, spacing them at least 2cm apart.
    Re-whisk egg wash to recombine and brush pequenes with egg wash.
    Using a toothpick or tip of paring knife, prick tops of pequenes for ventilation.

14. Bake one sheet tray at a time, rotating once halfway through, until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
    Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and repeat with remaining baking sheet.
    Let the pequenes cool for 10 minutes before serving.
