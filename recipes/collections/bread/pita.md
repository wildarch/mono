Yield: 6 pita breads.

## Ingredients
- 160ml milk
- 1 tsp caster sugar
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 7g yeast
- 320g bread flour

## Instructions
1. Add milk to a bowl and bring to room temperature.
Combine with sugar, yeast and 80ml of water. 
Let sit for 5 minutes until the yeast activates.

2. Add 1 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tsp salt and flour to the bowl, and mix well.

3. Lightly dust your working surface with flour and knead the dough for ~5 minutes.

4. Into a clean bowl, add 1 tbsp olive oil and coat the dough in it to keep from sticking. 
Cover and let rise for 40 minutes.

5. Drizzle some olive oil on the working surface. 
Drop the dough into the surface and press it down to remove air bubbles. 
Roll into a snake and cut into 6 pieces.
Flatten each piece into the shape of a pita.

6. Cook the pitas one by one in a frying pan with a little oil, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
