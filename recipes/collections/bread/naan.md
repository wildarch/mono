Makes 6 Naans.

## Ingredients
### Dough
- 250g white bread flour
- 5g salt
- 5g sugar
- 3g instant dry yeast
- 5g oil
- 200g yogurt
### Garlic butter
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 clove of garlic

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl combine the yogurt, yeast, salt, sugar, and oil. 
   Mix well. 
   Add the flour and mix to a dough. 
   Desired dough temperature around 23C (73F).
2. Cover and ferment for 1.5 – 2 hours.
   Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape into balls.
   Ferment for 30 minutes.
3. Roll out, dock with a fork, brush with oil and stack up on a plate ready for cooking. 
   The oil keeps the naan from sticking to each other.
4. Make the garlic butter: soften (but do not melt) the butter. 
   Mix in minced garlic.
   Season with a heavy pinch of salt.
5. Cook the flatbreads for 3 minutes on medium-high heat, flipping every 20 – 30 seconds. 
   Brush with garlic butter as soon as they come out the pan and stack them on top of each other.
