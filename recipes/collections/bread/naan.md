Makes 4 Naans.

## Ingredients
- 250g flour
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 tbsp oil
- 100ml milk
- 60g yoghurt
- 8 garlic cloves
- 2g fresh koriander

## Instructions
1. Combine all ingredients into a bowl and kneed until the dough is only slightly sticky, and bounces back when your press a finger into it.

2. Put the dough back into the bowl with a bit of oil to keep it from sticking. Cover with a towel for at least 30 minutes, but ideally multiple hours.

3. Split the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll them out with a rolling pin, almost as thin as you can get it.
Press 2 garlic cloves per naan and spread them over the flattened dough together with the koriander.
Use the rolling pin to roll the toppings into the dough.

4. Heat a pan (dry) over medium-high heat. 
Hold the first naan toppings down in one hand, wet your other hand lightly and brush the underside of the naan, creating a starchy paste
Place in the hot pan wet side down and do not disturb.
The bottom side is done when you smell the first hint of burning, flip it over and brown the top, this will be very quick!
Repeat for the other naan and serve.
