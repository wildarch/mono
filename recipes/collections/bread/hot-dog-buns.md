## Ingredients
- 500g bread flour (AP is also fine)
- 10g instant yeast
- 9g salt 
- 125ml whole milk, lukewarm
- 125ml water, lukewarm
- 1 egg
- 18g granulated sugar
- 45g butter
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tbsp milk

## Instructions
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together flour, yeast, and salt. 
   In a large bowl, whisk water, milk, egg, and sugar until sugar is dissolved.

2. Using a dough hook on low speed, slowly drizzle water mixture into flour mixture and mix, scraping down bowl as needed, until cohesive dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. 
   With mixer running, add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, waiting until the butter is fully incorporated into the dough before adding the next tablespoon, until all butter is fully incorporated, about 3 minutes. 
   Increase mixer speed to medium and knead for 8 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl but still sticks to the bottom.

3. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand to form a smooth round ball, about 1 minute. 
   In a lightly greased large bowl, place the dough seam side down, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a large plate, and let rise at room temperature, (20 to 23 â„ƒ), until the dough is doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

4. Divide the dough into 6 to 8 pieces. 
   Shape each piece into a smooth ball and set aside on the counter. 
   Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel.

5. Working with one dough ball at a time, flatten into a rectangle using a rolling pin.
   Roll out the dough tightly, and pinch the seam together.
   Place on a lined baking tray with the seam side down.
   Cover with a towel and leave to rise in a warm area for at least 45 minutes, until the dough has puffed up well.

6. Preheat the oven to 190C.
   Make the egg glaze by beating the egg yolk with the milk.
   Glaze the buns, and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
   Leave to cool completely before serving.
