Makes two pizzas.

## Ingredients
### Base (for 2 pizzas)
- 240g pizza or bread flour
- 0.125tsp instant yeast
- 0.5tsp sugar
- 8g salt

### Sauce (for 4 pizzas)
- 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- 5 cloves of garlic
- olive oil
- salt
- dried oregano

## Instructions
1. **Make the dough:** In a bowl, combine all the dry ingredients for the dough.
   Heat 170ml water to 40-45C, then add it to the mix.
   Stir until just combined.
2. Cover the bowl. 
   Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.
3. **Shaping:** Take the dough out of the bowl and place it onto a well-floured surface.
   Divide the dough in half using a dough scraper.
4. Stretch and fold it, as follows: 
   Holding onto the dough at both ends, pull one end away from the other, then fold it back onto itself. 
   Repeat on the other side. 
   The dough will likely be sticky â€” don't worry about it looking neat as you fold. 
   Be sure to keep your hands floured as you work.
5. Repeat this process on the other side of the dough, so that all four corners of the dough have been stretched and folded.
6. Next, pull the ends of the dough towards the middle, then turn it over. 
   Using your fingers, pull the dough under itself to make a smooth, round ball with the seams tucked into the bottom. 
   Cover the dough with a bowl or damp towel to keep it from drying out, and leave it to proof for 45 minutes to an hour.
7. In the meantime, preheat the oven to as high as it goes.
   Use a baking steel if you have it.
   Preheat the oven for the full time that the dough is proofing to ensure everything is up to temperature.
5. Make the sauce.
   Crush the garlic and fry on low heat for about 5 minutes, until it starts to colour.
   Add chopped tomatoes, salt and oregano.
   Cook on a low simmer for 15 minutes.
7. **Loading:** Stretch the dough out onto a cutting board, trying no to deflate the rim too much.
   Use some flour to keep things from sticking if you need to.
   If you accidentally tear the dough, try to patch it up as best you can, the pizza will still taste great.
8. Top the pizza with the sauce and anything else you fancy.
   I use 100g mozzarella per pizza, and bit of grated parmezan.
9. Slide the dough of the cutting board onto the baking steel (if using). 
   Bake for 6 minutes, then turn on the broiler and bake it for 2-3 minutes more until the top looks good.
