## Ingredients
### Dough
- 250g bread flour
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 3g instant dry yeast
- 6g salt
- 10g olive oil
- 20g honey
- 165ml warm water
- sesame seeds

### Boiling solution
- 1.5L water
- 40g honey
- 20g baking soda

## Instructions
1. Place an empty bowl on a scale and weigh out:
   * 165g warm water
   * 3g instant dry yeast
   * 6g salt
   * 10g olive oil
   * 20g honey
   * 50g whole wheat flour
   Mix very well with a whisk, making sure the honey and salt are fully dissolved.

2. Add 250g bread flour. Start mixing with a spoon, switch to pressing by hand once the spoon is no longer doing the job.
   This is a no-knead recipe, do not fully knead your dough at this stage, instead try to incorporate all the dry flour.

3. Cover and let the dough ferment for 40 minutes.

4. Lightly dust the dough and your working surface, then turn the dough out onto the surface.
   Perform a [fold](https://www.chainbaker.com/step-number-5-folding/).
   Wash out the bowl to get any remaining dry flour out, then place the dough back into the bowl and leave it to ferment for another 40 minutes.

5. Divide the dough into 5 equal-weight balls (using a scale helps).
   Shape them into nice tight balls, cover and let rest for another 30 minutes.

6. Once the balls have rested for 25 minutes, start to bring a saucepan to the boil with 1.5L of water.
   Add 2 tbsp honey and 4tsp baking soda (the soda will start to foam).

7. Make the bagel shape: Press your finger down into the dough ball to poke a hole into it.
   Gently stretch the bagel to make the hole bigger, about twice as big as you want it to be in the end.

8. Boil the bagels one-by-one, 20 seconds per side.
   Put the bagels in upside down, so that when they are done they are pointing upward.
   After boiling, place the bagels onto a cooling rack, and cover with sesame seeds (if using).

9. Once the bagels have cooled down completely, transfer them to a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
   Cover and let ferment in the fridge overnight (about 12 hours).

10. The next morning, bake the bagels in the oven at 210Â°C, for 20 minutes.
