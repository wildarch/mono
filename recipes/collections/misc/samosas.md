## Ingredients
- 1 onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 300g potato
- 100g frozen peas
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 0.5 tsp garam massala
- pinch chili flakes
- 1 jalapeno pepper
- thumb-sized piece of ginger
- 10 puff pastry sheets
- 15g fresh mint
- 150 ml greek yoghurt
- 1 tsp caster sugar

## Instructions
1. Peel and finely chop the onion and potatoes (do not mix them).
   Heat oil in a deep frying pan and fry the onion for a few minutes, until starting to brown.

2. Mince the garlic and ginger. 
   Add them to the pan together with the spices and chili flakes. 
   Fry until fragrant.

3. Add potatoes to the pan and pour in enough water (or stock) to cover everything.
   If using plain water, salt generously.

4. Simmer uncovered until the potatoes are very soft. 
   This should not take much longer than 10 minutes of the potatoes are chopped very finely.
   By the end almost all of the water should be evaporated.
   If the pan is dry before the potatoes are fully cooked, add a bit more water and cook for longer.
   Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. Stir in chopped jalapeno and frozen peas, then leave to cool down completely.

6. Pick and chop the mint leaves, then stir into the yoghurt.
   Add a big pinch of sugar and a little pinch of salt.
   Blend to a smooth sauce, adding more sugar to taste.

7. Preheat the oven according to the instructions for the puff pastry.

8. Take the pastry sheets out of the freezer and let thaw for a few minutes, until pliable.
   Divide the filling over the pastry equally, and fold them into triangles. 
   Bake until golden brown, ~20 minutes.
