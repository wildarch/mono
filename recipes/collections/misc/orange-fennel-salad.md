Serves: 4

## Ingredients
- 1 fennel bulb
- 2 oranges
- 1 small red onion
- 85g rocket
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp mustard

## Instructions
1. Remove the tough core from the fennel, then slice very thinly.
2. Peel the oranges. Cut each segment into quarters.
   If the oranges are leaking a lot of juice, catch it in a bowl and mix through the salad later.
3. Thinly slice the onion, then in a large salad bowl combine with the fennel, orange chunks and rocket.
4. Make the dressing by combining the olive oil and mustard. Drizzle over the salad and serve.
