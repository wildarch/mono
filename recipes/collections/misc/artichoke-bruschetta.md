## Ingredients
- 1 jar of artichoke hearts (in oil)
- 5 garlic cloves
- lemon juice
- 1 handful of fresh mint
- 1 baguette
- extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions
1. Soften *4* of the garlic cloves. 
You can do this by cooking them in the oven for 15 mins, boiling them for 5 minutes, or frying them with the skin on.

2. Fry the artichoke pieces in a bit of oil for a few minutes, until they have some colour on them.
   Set aside 4 pretty artichoke pieces.  

3. To the cooked artichokes, add the cooked garlic (skins removed), roughly chopped mint leaves, some lemon juice, salt and pepper, then mash everything together.

4. Slice and toast the bread.
   Peel and cut in half a garlic clove. 
   Rub each toasted slice of bread with the garlic, and drizzle over a bit of olive oil.

5. Spread the mashed artichoke over the bread, and top with a part of the reserved pieces for decoration.
   You can optionally grate over some parmesan cheese as well.
