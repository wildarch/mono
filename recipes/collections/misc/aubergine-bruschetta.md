## Ingredients
- 2 aubergines
- 8 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 sprigs flat leaf parsley
- 1 handful mint leaves
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 baguette

## Instructions
1. Slice the aubergine into thin strips.
   Grill until nicely charred on both sides.
2. Finely chop the herbs, then mix with olive oil and white wine vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Add the aubergine and leave to marinate.
3. Slice and toast the bread.
   Peel and cut in half a garlic clove. 
   Rub each toasted slice of bread with the garlic, and drizzle over a bit of olive oil.
4. Top the bread with the aubergine.
   For bonus points on presentation you can roll up the aubergine slices.  
   Try to also get some of the dressing onto the bruschetta.
