## Ingredients
- 175g lardon alternative
- 270g pie pastry
- 200g grated emmental cheese
- 5 eggs
- 200g creme fraiche
- 1 broccoli
- 1tsp grated nutmeg

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200C.
   Cut the broccoli head into little florets and finely dice the stem. 
   Toss with salt and olive oil, then roast in the oven until lightly browned, around 20 minutes.
   Once the broccoli is done, lower the temperature to 180C.

2. Fry the lardons in plenty of oil for a few minutes.

3. Whisk together the eggs, creme fraiche and nutmeg, 
   then mix in the cheese, lardons and roasted broccoli.

4. Grease a 28cm spring form.
   Roll out the dough and place it into the spring form.
   Only the bottom and sides need to be covered in pastry, the top will remain open.
   Pour in the filling, and bake until fully set and golden brown, around 45 minutes.
