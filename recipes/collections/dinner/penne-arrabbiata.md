Serves 2.

## Ingredients
- 300g penne
- 2 garlic cloves
- chili flakes
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 can of crushed tomato
- parmesan cheese

## Instructions
1. In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook penne until just short of al dente, about 1 minute less than the package recommends. 
Do not use too much water too avoid diluting the starch in the pasta water.

2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine oil, garlic, and pepper flakes. 
Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. 
(Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.)

3. Cut the bell pepper into bite-size chunks, and add to the pan.
   Fry for a few minutes until slightly softened but not fully cooked.

4. Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. 
When pasta is ready, transfer it to sauce using a strainer or slotted spoon. 
(Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of cooking water. Add drained pasta to sauce.)

5. Add about 30ml pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and sauce to a vigorous simmer. 
Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
(The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in the water.)

Continue cooking pasta until sauce thickens and begins to coat noodles, then remove from heat and toss in cheese, stirring vigorously to incorporate. 
Stir in a drizzle of fresh olive oil, if desired. 
Season with salt and serve right away, passing more cheese at the table. 
Garnish with fresh herbs if you have them.
