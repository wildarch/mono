## Ingredients
- 1 Courgette
- 15g basil
- 20g Parmigiano Reggiano (or another Italian hard cheese)
- 20g butter
- 200g spaghetti

## Instructions
1. Thinly and evenly slice the courgette. 
   Heat a generous amount of olive oil in small skillet, enough to fully submerge the courgette slices.
   Fry the courgette in batches until deeply browned (but not burnt).
   Cook it fast to keep the courgette from going mush.
   Once the first batch is done frying, dump the contents of the skillet into sieve set on top of a small pot.
   Then continue with the next batch, pour the oil back into the skillet.

2. While the courgette is frying, roughly chop the basil and grate the cheese.

3. Cook the pasta until al dente, reserving a full cup of the starchy cooking water.

4. Add the courgette and pasta to a large pan and place over high heat.
   Add some pasta water and reduce.
   Cook until the pasta is just about done.
   Add the basil, butter and black pepper.
   Stir until homogenous and emulsified, with a thickness resembling heavy cream.

5. Take the pan off the heat, then stir in the cheese.
   Serve immediately.
