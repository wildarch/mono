Serves: 2

## Ingredients
- 500g starchy potatoes
- 1tbsp vinegar
- oil

## Instructions
1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into fries.
2. Preheat the oven to 230Â°C. 
3. Bring a pot of water to the boil. Add a heavy pinch of salt and the vinegar. The salt will internally season the fries, while the vinegar will keep them firm. Boil for 10 minutes, then drain.
4. Place the fries onto a baking sheet and drizzle with lots of oil.
5. Bake until crispy and slightly brown (40-50 minutes). Flip them over after the first 20 minutes.
