Serves: 2

## Ingredients
- 50g lettuce
- 1 cucumber
- 200g cherry tomatoes
- 1 aubergine
- 225g halloumi
- 4 tbsp yoghurt
- 4 large tortilla wraps
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp dried thyme

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. 
Cut the aubergine into 1cm slices and lay them out onto a baking tray. Drizzle with oil and bake for 20 mins until soft.

2. Slice the halloumi in 5-10mm thick slices. 
Make the marinade by mixing 1 tbsp honey with 2 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp thyme. 
Coat the halloumi in marinade and set aside while prepping the other vegetables.

3. Cut the cucumber lengthwise and slice into thin wedges. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half.

4. Put the halloumi slices into a wide flat pan without a non-stick coating (easier to clean later).
Place over high heat and fry the halloumi until golden brown.

5. Assemble the wraps: a spoon of yoghurt goes on the wrap together with a small squeeze of honey. 
Fill with the lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, aubergine and halloumi.
