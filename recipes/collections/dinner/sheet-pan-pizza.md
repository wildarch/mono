Perfectly fits a 35x38cm sheet pan. 
Serves at least 4 people.

## Ingredients
### Dough
- 500g bread flour
- 50g olive oil
- 10g salt
- 4g yeast
- 380g water

### Sauce
- 400g quality tinned tomato
- 4g salt
- 20g olive oil
- heavy pinch oregano
- 1 clove of garlic
- few basil leaves

### Topping
- 400g mozzarella
- 60g salami
- few basil leaves

## Instructions
1. Make the dough. 
   In a large bowl combine the water, yeast, salt, and oil. 
   Mix well to dissolve the salt. Add the flour and mix to a dough.
   Desired dough temperature 25°C.

2. Cover and chill the dough for 20 minutes.

3. Fold #1 (use coil folding technique). Chill for another 20 minutes.

4. Fold #2. Cold ferment for 12 to 24 hours.

5. Shape the dough (make it a bit rectangular, without de-gassing it) and place it on a greased tray. Use plenty of oil, just like a foccacia.

6. Cover and final proof for 2 hours. 
   Rub some oil over the top of the dough to prevent it from sticking to the cling film. 
   During the final hour of fermentation pre-heat the oven to 250°C.

7. Make the sauce. Combine all ingredients and blend until smooth.

8. Chop or tear the mozzarella into small chunks (go for lots of surface area).
    Squeeze to draw out as much moisture as possible.
    Then put on a plate and without covering it, place it in the fridge to draw out more water.

9. Stretch the dough (you can dimple it a bit like foccacia) to fill the tray. 
   Top with sauce, mozzarella, salami and a bit of oregano.

10. Place the pizza in the oven (middle rack) and turn the temperature down to 230°C. 
    Bake for 25 minutes.

11. Leave to set for 10 minutes and remove it from the tray.
