Serves 4.

## Ingredients
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- chilli flakes
- 600g carrots
- 140g split red lentils
- 1l vegetable stock
- 125ml milk
- bread

## Instructions
1. Roughly chop the carrots.

2. Heat a large pan and dry-fry 2 tsp cumin seeds and a pinch of chilli flakes for 1 min, or until fragrant.

3. Scoop out about half with a spoon and set aside. 
Add 2 tbsp olive oil, carrots, split red lentils, stock and milk to the pan and bring to the boil.

5. Whizz the soup with a stick blender until smooth.

6. Season to taste and finish with a sprinkling of the reserved toasted spices.

## Notes
The original recipe suggests Naan bread, but any crusty loaf with some (herb) butter works great.
