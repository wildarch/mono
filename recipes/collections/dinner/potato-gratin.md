Serves: 6.

## Ingredients
- 1kg potatoes
- 225g smoked gouda
- 6 garlic cloves
- 250ml cream
- 25g butter
- 5g fresh thyme
- milk

## Instructions
1. Cut the potatoes into thin slices (no need to peel them). 
   Fill the baking dish with them until almost full.
2. Grate up the smoked gouda (don't forget to trim off the brown skin) and set aside for later.
3. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
4. Heat up a large pan. Melt the butter, then press and add the garlic. 
   Fry until the garlic is just starting to turn golden, then throw in the potatoes and pour in enough cream to almost cover the potatoes. 
   If you do not have enough cream you can top it off with a bit of milk.
5. Stir the mixture continuously so all potatoes are covered in liquid, and the bottom does not burn.
   Add plenty of black pepper and a pinch of salt.
   After a few minutes you should see the liquid start to thicken, at this point take the pan off the heat. 
6. When the mixture stops bubbling, dump in the cheese (if you add the cheese too soon, it will split).
   Stir until the cheese has melted and the mixture is homogenous.
7. Taste a potato slice to check for seasoning, and adjust as necessary.
8. As late as possible, stir in the thyme. 
   Pour the mixture into the baking dish, and bake in the top rack until brown at the top (~30min). 
   Do not leave it in for too long, or the sauce will start to separate.

## Info
You can use both floury and waxy potatoes.

When shopping in a Dutch supermarket: Smoked Gouda is sold as [*Rookkaas*](https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi513428/ah-rookkaas-45-plakken). For cream you can use [*Slagroom*](https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi195844/de-zaanse-hoeve-slagroom).
