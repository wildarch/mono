Serves: 2

## Ingredients
- 1 onion
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 hot chile 
- 3 cloves garlic 
- 1.5 tbsp smoked paprika
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 800g canned crushed tomatoes
- 4 large eggs
- sugar
- fresh coriander
- 100g feta
- bread

## Steps
1. Cut the onion and bell pepper into slices.
   Finely slice the chile.
2. Heat olive oil in a wide skillet over high heat until shimmering. 
   Add onion, red pepper, and chile and spread into an even layer. 
   Cook, without moving, until vegetables on the bottom are deeply browned and beginning to char in spots, about 6 minutes. 
3. Stir and repeat. 
   Continue to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another 4 minutes.
4. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
   Add paprika and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
   Immediately add tomatoes and stir to combine. 
   Reduce heat to a bare simmer and simmer for 10 minutes.
5. Add a pinch of sugar if the sauce tastes too acidic, and season to taste with salt. 
6. Using a large spoon, make a well near the perimeter of the pan and break an egg directly into it. 
   Spoon a little sauce over edges of egg white to partially submerge and contain it, leaving yolk exposed. 
   Repeat with remaining eggs, working around pan as you go. 
   Season eggs with a little salt, cover, reduce heat to lowest setting, and cook until egg whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, 5 to 8 minutes.
7. Serve with roughly chopped coriander and crumbled feta.
