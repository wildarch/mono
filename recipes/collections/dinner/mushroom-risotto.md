## Ingredients
- 2 mushroom stock cubes
- 1 onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 250g chestnut mushrooms
- 300g risotto rice
- 175ml white wine
- 25g butter
- 50g parmesan


## Instructions
1. Cut the mushrooms into slices. 
   Place them into a frying skillet without any oil, and pour in a bit of water (half a glass).
   Stream for 4 to 8 minutes until the mushrooms have cooked down and most of the water has evaporated.

2. Add a little bit of oil to the frying pan. 
   Brown for 4-8 minutes, then set aside.

3. Meanwhile, finely dice the onion.
   Fry the onions in a large pot until soft, then crush and add the garlic until fragrant.

4. Tip the risotto rice into the pan and cook for 1 minute, until the rice smells nutty.
   Pour over the wine and wait for the liquid to evaporate.

5. Make mushroom stock by adding the stock cubes to 1L of water.
   Add enough of the stock to the pot to keep the rice covered.

6. Cook for 20-25 minutes until the rice is nearly done, adding more stock as necessary.
   Turn off the heat, stir in the mushrooms, butter and parmesan.
   Leave the rest for a few minutes, then serve.
