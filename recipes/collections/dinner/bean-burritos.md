## Ingredients
### Coriander-lime rice
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 10g coriander
- 2tbsp lime juice

### Bean filling
- 1 small onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 can black beans
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 0.5 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp hot sauce
- 4 flour tortillas

### Pico de Gallo
- 0.5 small onion
- 1 clove garlic
- 250g sweet tomatoes
- 1 jalapeño
- 5g coriander
- 1 tbsp lime juice

## Instructions
1. **Pico de Gallo**: Dice the onion and press the garlic. 
   Put them into a sieve and lower into boiling water for 30 seconds. 
   Leave to drain and cool.
2. Finely chop tomatoes, jalapeño and coriander.
   Mix all ingredients together into a jar.
   Season with salt and pepper.
   Refrigerate until needed, ideally at least 2 hours.
   
3. **Make the filling**: Finely dice the onion and fry over medium-high heat until soft, around 5 minutes.
   Add minced garlic and cook for one minute more.
4. Lower the heat, then add the beans (drained) along with the chili powder, cumin and hot sauce. 
   Adjust spice quantities to taste, adding salt as needed.
   Once everything is heated through, turn off the heat.

5. **Rice**: Chop the coriander. Mix through the rice, adding lime juice to taste. 
   It should be too sour on its own, since the filling is quite savory.
   You can use leftover rice without any problems if you reheat it.
6. Fill the burritos with rice, bean filling and pico de gallo.
   *Sour cream, avocado and grated cheese are all great additions*.
