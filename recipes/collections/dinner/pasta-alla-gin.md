Server 2.

## Ingredients
- 1 shallot
- 3 garlic cloves
- 0.25tsp chili flakes
- 100g tomato purée
- 5 tbsp gin
- 100ml double cream
- 200g penne
- 30g parmesan

## Instructions
1. Finely dice the shallot.
   Fry over low heat until softened, about 10 minutes.
2. Add garlic (crushed) and the chili flakes.
   Fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Stir through the tomato purée. 
   Cook for around 2 minutes, until it takes on a rust-like colour.
4. Add the gin.
   Wait for it to evaporate, then stir in the cream.
   Remove from the heat.
5. Cook the pasta for a little shorter than the instructions (we will finish it in the sauce).
   Drain, saving 150ml of cooking water.
6. Add the pasta to the sauce along with ~50ml of the cooking water and the cheese.
   Stir until emulsified, adding more pasta water as necessary.
7. Serve with black pepper and basil leaves.
