## Ingredients (dough)
- 150g all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 4 tbsp water
- pinch of salt

## Ingredients (topping)
- 100g green lentils, boiled for 15 minutes
- 3 large onions, thinly sliced
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1/3 tsp red pepper powder
- 1/3 tsp red pepper flakes
- 6 tbsp greek yoghurt
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions
1. To make the dough, mix and knead all the ingredients in a bowl. 
   Cover and let it rest around 15-20 minutes.

2. To make the caramelized onion, pour olive oil in a large pan. 
   Add a pinch of salt and brown onions on medium heat stirring occasionally.

3. Roll out the dough. 
   Divide the rested dough 2 pieces, lightly flour the counter and rolling pin so that the dough does not stick. 
   Take the dough, flour it and roll out until 2-3 mm thick and rectangle shape.

4. First cut the dough into 4 cm strips and then cut into triangles. 
   Boil the dough in a big pot around 2-3 minutes. 

5. To make the garlic yoghurt, mix garlic, 1 pinch salt, 2 tablespoons of cooking water and yoghurt.

6. To make the butter sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan. 
   When butter sizzles and browns take the pan from the direct heat and slowly shake to form a foamy texture. 
   Add red pepper powder, red pepper flakes and shake again, this way pepper wonâ€™t burn and give its color to the butter.

7. Place the boiled dough to the bottom, pour some garlic yoghurt on them, add boiled lentils and caramelized onion, butter. 
   Imagine this as a layer and put one more layer. 
   Again, place more dough, yoghurt, lentils, caramelized onion and pour rest of the butter lastly.
