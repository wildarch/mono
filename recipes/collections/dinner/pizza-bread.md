Serves: 2

## Ingredients
- 45g unsalted butter
- 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic
- red pepper flakes
- 0.5 tsp oregano
- 1 large bagette
- 400g crushed tomatoes
- 200g mozzarella cheese
- 60g parmezan cheese

## Steps
1. If your mozzarella is already dry, skip this step.
   Squeeze the ball of mozzarella to force some of the water out.
   Shred the ball into little bits and place them on a wide plate.
   Put the plate in the fridge (uncovered) for as long as possible to extract moisture.

1. Heat butter and olive oil in a saucepan until butter is melted. 
   Add garlic, pepper flakes, oregano, a big pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. 

2. Split the baguette in half lengthwise and crosswise.
   Press down on it with a baking sheet to make it less tall and a bit wider.
   Place the bread on top of the baking sheet, then brush half the garlic butter mixture over the bread.

3. Preheat the oven to 220Â°C.

4. To the remaining garlic butter mixture, add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer.
   Cook, stirring occasionally, until rich and reduced, about 15 minutes. 
   Season to taste with salt.

5. While sauce cooks, spread 1/4 of mozzarella evenly over surface of bread and transfer to oven. 
   Cook until cheese is barely melted, about 8 minutes. 
   Remove from oven and set aside until sauce is cooked.

6. Spread sauce evenly over bread, then spread remaining mozzarella on top of sauce. 
   Transfer to oven and bake until cheese is melted and just starting to brown, about 10 minutes. 
   Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano. 
   Allow to cool slightly and serve.
