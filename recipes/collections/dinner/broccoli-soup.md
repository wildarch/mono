Serves: 3.

## Ingredients
- 25g unsalted butter
- 600g broccoli
- 1 onion
- 1 clove garlic 
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- cayenne pepper
- 0.125 tsp baking soda
- vegetable stock cube
- 40g mature cheese
- 20g parmesan cheese

## Instructions
1. Heat the butter over medium-high heat.
   Rougly chop the onion, and fry for at least 5 minutes, or until brown. You can add a bit of water at the start to help the onions break down.
2. In a mortar and pestle, grind down the mustard seeds with the garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper.
   Add to the onions, cook until fragrant.
3. To 250ml of water, add the baking soda, and pour everything into the pan. Bring to the boil.
4. Cut off the broccoli florets and slice the stem into thin slices. 
   Place in the pan, cover with a lid, and let it cook/steam 20 minutes. Stir the pot once after 10 minutes.
   Towards the end the broccoli will look overcooked, but that is fine.
5. Take the pan off the heat. 
   Grate in the cheeses, and blend until smooth.
   Add the vegetable stock cube dissolved in 500ml hot water, then place back on the stove and heat until boiling again.
6. Season with black pepper (and extra cheese).
   Serve with bread.
