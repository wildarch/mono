Serves: 8.
The sauce will keep in the fridge for up to a week.

## Ingredients
### Sauce
- 100g parmigiano reggiano
- 150g pecorino romano
- 15g olive oil
- 4 tsp whole black pepper corns
- 10g corn starch

### Pasta (per person)
- 125g spaghetti
- pecorino romano

## Instructions
For the sauce:
1. Make the corn starch gel. 
   Add the corn starch and 150ml of cold water to a saucepan, and mix well to dissolve the starch.
   Place over low heat. 
   Whisk continuously until thickened to a gel, then remove from the heat.
   The mixture should thicken just before the water comes to a boil.
2. Create the sauce.
   Grate the cheeses.
   Crush the black pepper in a pestle and mortar (do not make them too fine).
   Add both to a container suitable for an immersion blender along with 15g olive oil.
   Pulse once or twice.
   Pour in the cornstarch gel and blend everything together to create a stable emulsion.
3. Store in the fridge for up to a week.

To make the dish:
1. Boil the pasta until a minute or two shy of being al dente.
   Be conservative with the amount of water used.
   Drain the pasta, **reserving the pasta water**, and toss the pasta with some olive oil to keep it from sticking to each other.
2. To a (cold) frying pan, add 2 heaping spoonfuls of the sauce along with a splash of the pasta water.
   Mix together.
3. Add the still-hot pasta and cream together. 
   Turn the heat on (medium-low) and slowly bring up the temperature of the sauce while mixing with the pasta. 
   Be a little careful, but this can come to a light simmer without breaking.
4. Once the sauce reaches the right consistency and the pasta is fully cooked, serve immediately.
   Top with grated pecorino romano.
