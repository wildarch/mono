Serves: 4

## Ingredients
- 7g coriander
- 2 red chilies
- 1 tbsp garam massala
- 2 red onions
- 5 cloves of garlic
- thumb-sized piece of ginger
- 400g canned tomatoes
- 70g tomato paste
- 800g canned chickpeas
- lemon juice
- 300g rice

## Instructions
1. Roughly chop the onion, chillies and ginger.
Heat plenty of oil in a large pan, add the massala right away. 
Once fragrant, crush in garlic and put in the chillies, ginger and tomato paste.

2. When things are about to burn, dump in the tomatoes and onions.
Fry until much of the water has evaporated and things have browned a bit. 

3. Use a hand blender to make the sauce as smooth as possible.
Drain the chickpeas and add to the sauce, along with enough water to cover everything.
Simmer for 15 minutes. Make sure the sauce does not get too dry, add more water as necessary.

4. Taste a chickpea. 
Add salt or other spices as necessary.
Brighten up the sauce with a splash of lemon juice and freshly copped coriander, right before serving.
