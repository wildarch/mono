Serves: 6

## Ingredients
- 6 ripe tomatoes
- 1 bulb garlic
- 15g fresh thyme
- 3 vegetable stock cubes
- 1 onion
- 1 bulb fennel
- 60g butter
- 500g risotto rice
- 250ml dry white wine
- 80g parmesan cheese

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC.
   With a knife, cut the cores out of the tomatoes, then place cut side down in a snug-fitting baking dish with the whole garlic bulb, and scatter over the thyme sprigs.

2. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, season with salt, and roast for 1 hour, or until starting to burst open (the juices will add game-changing flavour later on).

3. Peel and finely chop the onion and fennel, reserving any herby tops, then place in a casserole on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half of the butter.

4. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally, then stir in the rice to toast for 2 minutes. 
   Pour in the wine and stir until absorbed. 

5. Crumble in the stock cubes.
   Gradually add boiling water to the rice, keeping the rice just submerged, about 16-18 minutes.
   Once the rice is nearly cooked you can stop adding water to let the risotto thicken a bit.
   Note that the risotto will thicken some more once we add the cheese.

6. Beat in the remaining butter, finely grate and beat in the Parmesan, then season to perfection and turn the heat off. 
   Cover the pan and leave to relax for 2 minutes so the risotto becomes creamy and oozy.

7. Divide the risotto between warm plates, place a tomato in the centre with a little sweet garlic and the herby fennel tops, then drizzle over the tasty tomato juices.
