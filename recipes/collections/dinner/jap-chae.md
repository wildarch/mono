Serves: 2

## Ingredients
- 200g frozen spinach
- 200g shiitake mushrooms
- 1 orange or yellow bell pepper
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp dark brown sugar
- 2 tsp maple syrup
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 100g glass noodles (ideally dangmyeon, sweet potato noodles)

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 220C.

2. Thinly slice the mushrooms and bell pepper.
   On a large sheet pan, arrange the spinach, mushrooms and bell pepper in three separate sections.
   Generously drizzle all with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. 
   Roast until charred in spots, gently stirring the vegetable sections one by one and rotating the pan halfway through, 20 to 25 minutes.

3. In a small bowl, stir together the garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar, maple syrup and sesame seeds and set aside.

4. When the vegetables are almost done roasting, add the noodles to boiling water and cook according to package instructions, then drain and add directly to the sheet pan with the roasted vegetables. 
   Using kitchen shears, cut the noodles once or twice directly on the sheet pan for easier handling.

5. Pour the sauce over and toss until all ingredients are evenly distributed. 
   Taste for seasoning, adding more salt, soy sauce and sesame seeds if you like. 
   Serve warm or at room temperature.
