Serves: 5.

## Ingredients
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 3 sticks celery
- 1 large winter carrot
- 375g vegetarian mince
- 70g tin tomato puree
- 150ml red wine
- 700ml whole milk
- 500g passata
- 50g butter
- 60g flour
- 100g parmigiano reggiano
- 16 sheets of dry lasagna

## Instructions
1. Finely chop the onion, celery and carrot.
   Add to a large casserole together with the garlic (minced) and fry for 5 minutes.

2. Add the mince and fry for a few minutes, followed by the tomato puree.
   The tomato puree should turn a rust-like colour before proceeding.

3. Pour in the wine, let it reduce fully, then do the same with 200ml of milk.

4. Add the passata and bring to the boil.
   Leave on a low simmer (partly covered with a lid) for 45 minutes.

5. In the meantime, make the bechamel sauce.
   Melt the butter in saucepan.
   Stir in the flour and fry it for a few minutes, about 3 minutes.

6. Gradually whisk in the remaining milk (500ml). 
   Add the milk in small batches, ensuring the sauce is homogenous before adding more milk.
   Bring to the boil and keep at a low simmer for 2-3 minutes.
   Season with salt and pepper.

7. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
   Grate up the parmesan cheese.
   In a rectangular baking dish (30x20cm), make thin layers in the following order:
   1. tomato sauce
   2. lasagna sheets (try to avoid overlapping sheets)
   3. tomato sauce
   4. bechamel sauce
   5. grated parmesan

   Repeat layers 2 to 5 three more times.

8. Bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes, until the top is deeply browned.
