## Ingredients
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 shallot
- 1 thai bird chile
- 2 tbsp peanut oil
- 200g vegetarian mince
- 250g haricots verts
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 15g basil leaves
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup rice

## Instructions
1. Roughly chop the garlic, shallot and chile and place in the mortar.
   Add a small pinch of salt.
   Pound with the pestle until roughly mashed (no need to form a paste).

2. Trim the ends off the haricots verts and chop up them into bite-size pieces.
   Start cooking the rice before proceeding to ensure it will be done in time.

2. Combine 2 tbsp of peanut oil with the garlic/shallot/chile mixture in a wok or skillet and place over medium-high heat.
   Cook, stirring frequently, until the aromatics are lightly softened and the oil is fragrant, about 30 seconds after it starts sizzling.

3. Add the mince and haricots verts.
   Cook, stirring and tossing for about 4 minutes, or until the beans are tender-crisp.
   
   Add the 2 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp dark soy sauce and 1 tbsp oyster sauce.
   Continue to cook until most of the liquid is evaporated but the mixture is still nice and moist, about 1 minute.

4. Remove the work or skillet from the heat.
   Add the basil and toss to combine until wilted.
   Divide immediately over bowls with the cooked rice.

5. Fry the eggs over high heat, and place them on top of the bowls.
   Serve immediately.
