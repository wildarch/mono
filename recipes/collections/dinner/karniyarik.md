## Ingredients
- 4 Eggplants
- 300 g double ground beef, preferably rib or brisket cut. Or sub with vegetarian mince.
- 2 onions, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 10-15 sprigs parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon tomato puree
- 400g tomato pulp
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus extra for seasoning the eggplants
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 4 green peppers
- 2 tomatoes, quartered
- Sunflower oil, or any frying oil for shallow-frying

## Instructions
1. Peel the eggplants in stripes like a “pyjama” pattern, leaving alternating strips of skin. 
   Prick them a few times with a knife to prevent bursting. 
   Heat oil in a pan—enough to come halfway up the sides of the eggplants—and fry them until lightly browned and softened. 
   Drain on a sieve.
2. While the eggplants are frying, start browning the ground beef in a separate pan over medium heat. 
   Once it starts to change colour, add the diced onions and half of the salt and black pepper. 
   Sauté together until the onions completely soften, caramelised and almost nonvisible. 
3. Add the garlic, tomato pulp, tomato paste, vinegar, and sugar. 
   Stir well to combine and cook for another 1-2 minutes. 
   Turn off the heat and mix in most of the chopped parsley, saving a bit for garnish.
4. Place the fried eggplants in a baking dish. 
   Cut a slit down the centre of each eggplant without slicing all the way through. 
   Gently press the sides apart to make space for filling. 
   Season the insides lightly with salt. 
   Spoon the beef mixture into each eggplant.
5. Place quartered tomatoes and  green peppers alongside of each stuffed eggplant. 
   Bake in a preheated oven at 220°C (430°F) for 15–20 minutes, until everything is slightly roasted and bubbling.
6. Once out of the oven, sprinkle the remaining parsley over the top. 
   Karnıyarık is best enjoyed with the classic summer trio in Turkey: plain rice pilaf, cacık (yogurt with cucumber and mint), or just plain yogurt. Simple and delicious.
