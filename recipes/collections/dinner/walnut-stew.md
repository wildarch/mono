Serves 6-8.

## Ingredients
- 3 aubergines (900g)
- 28g salt
- 1 large onion (200g)
- 300g walnuts
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- black peper
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 50g tomato paste
- 60g pomegranate molasses
- 200g ice cubes
- Rice (to serve)

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 220C.
   Cut aubergines lengthwise into 1cm thick slices, and arrange in a single layer on a large baking tray.
   Season generously with salt and rub will olive oil on all sides.
   Roast in the oven for 25 minutes, or until completely tender.

2. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large casserole over medium-low heat. 
   Peel and finely chop the onion and sauté it in the oil until it turns translucent (8-10 minutes). 
   Meanwhile, add the walnuts to a food processor and blend until they turn into a coarse paste. 
   They’re ground fine enough when some of them start breaking down into a walnut butter along the sides of the food processor.

3. Add the ground walnuts to the onions and sauté for 1-2 minutes until they smell aromatic. 
   Tip in the cinnamon, pepper and turmeric and cook for a minute to heat them through. 
   Add the tomato paste, pomegranate molasses and the remaining tablespoon of salt (14g), stir well and cook for another minute, then pour in 500ml of cold water along with the ice cubes. 
   Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer covered for 30 minutes until the stew has thickened and the oil from the walnuts floats on the surface.

4. Cut aubergines slices into bite-sized chunks. 
   Add to the stew and gently stir them in, then cook covered for 10 minutes more. 
   By now, you should see rapid bubbles cutting through the oil and blipping on the surface, a sign that it’s ready. 
   Divide the stew over bowls and serve alongside freshly steamed rice.
