## Ingredients
### Base (per pizza)
- 120ml water
- 0.5 tsp instant dry yeast
- 0.5 tsp olive oil
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp sugar
- 120g bread flour

### Sauce (for 4 pizzas)
- 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- 5 cloves of garlic
- olive oil
- salt
- dried oregano

## Instructions
1. Add the water (120ml), yeast, sugar, olive oil (1/2 tsp each) and salt (1/4 tsp) to a bowl.
   Mix well to combine.
   With a spoon, stir in as much bread flour as the water will easily accept.
   There is no need to go in with your hands at this point.
   Cover and let rest (autolyse) for 15-30 minutes.
2. After resting, the dough should be fermenting and a lot stickier.
   Again, stir in as much bread flour as the dough will easily accept.
   The more you stir in, the easier it will be to handle the dough.
   On the other hand, a wetter dough gives you more air in the dough and final pizza, which I like.
   Cover again and let rise for 2 hours, or until doubled.
3. Gather one small sealable container per pizza. 
   Put a bit of olive oil in each container.
   Divide the dough over the containers, using the dough itself to spread the olive oil around in the containers.
   It helps to use a bit of flour or to wet your hand when dividing the dough to keep it from sticking to your hand too much.
4. Seal the containers.
   If you want to bake it right away, let it sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.
   You can also some the dough for later in the fridge.
   The dough will actually develop better flavour if you leave it there for a few days, upto a week.
   Pull the dough out of the fridge 30 minutes to an hour before you plan to use it.
5. Make the sauce.
   Crush the garlic and fry on low heat for about 5 minutes, until it starts to colour.
   Add chopped tomatoes, salt and oregano.
   Cook on a low simmer for 15 minutes.
6. Preheat your oven to as high as it goes (250C for me).
7. Stretch the dough out onto a baking tray, trying no to deflate the rim too much.
   Use some flour to keep things from sticking if you need to.
   If you accidentally tear the dough, try to patch it up as best you can, the pizza will still taste great.
8. Top the pizza with the sauce and anything else you fancy.
   I use 100g mozzarella per pizza, and bit of grated parmezan.
