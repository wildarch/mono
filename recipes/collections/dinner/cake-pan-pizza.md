A pizza recipe that is easy to make at home without special equipment.

## Ingredients
- 120ml warm water
- pinch of sugar
- 1 tsp dry yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 150g bread flour
- olive oil
- 100ml tomato pulp
- dried oregano
- vinegar
- 50g mozzarella

## Instructions
Put the water into a mixing bowl. 
Stir in sugar and yeast. 
Once the yeast starts to bloom, add the flour, salt and olive oil. 
Stir in as much flour as possible with a spoon, do not knead the dough. 
Cover and let rise in the fridge for at least a day.

Line a 24cm springform pan with parchment paper (crumbling it up first makes it easier to fit it). 
Apply a thin coat of olive oil.

Fold the dough over onto itself a few times using the spoon, then using your hand stretch it out in the air and lay it out into the pan. 
Stretch it out as best as possible (it doesn't have to be perfect), then leave to proof for about 1 hour at room temperature.

Preheat the oven to its max setting.
Make the sauce by mixing tomato pulp, oregano and a tiny splash of vinegar. 
Top the pizza with the sauce, and sprinkle over the mozzarella.
Go easy on the sauce, you might not need it all.

Place the pizza at the bottom of the oven until it is almost finished, about 9 minutes. 
Take the pizza out of the pan and place it onto a rack. 
Switch the oven to only heat the bottom element, and place the pizza back into the oven for 4 minutes.
