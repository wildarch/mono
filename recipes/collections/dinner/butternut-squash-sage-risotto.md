Serves: 4

## Ingredients
- 1 butternut squash
- 10g sage
- 2 vegetable stock cubes
- 25g butter
- 1 onion
- 300g risotto rice
- 25cl white wine
- 50g parmesan cheese

## Instructions
1. Heat the oven to 220Â°C. 
Dice the squash, and toss it with 1 tbsp of oil and the sage (chopped). Scatter into a roasting tin and bake for 30 minutes until soft.

2. Finely chop the onion. 
Melt the butter into a large pan, and gently cook the onion until soft but not brown, around 10 minutes. 

3. Stir in the rice and fry until the rice is shiny and the edges of the grain start to look transparent.

4. Pour in the wine and simmer until completely evaporated.
Add the stock cubes along with enough hot water to submerge the rice. 
Cookk for approximately 20-30 minutes until the rice is al dente, adding more water as necessary to keep the rice submerged until it is nearly done.

4. When the squash is cooked, mash half of it and mix it with the risotto. When serving, top the risotto with the remaining half of the squash and the cheese (grated).
