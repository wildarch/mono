## Ingredients (sauce)
- 400ml can whole peeled tomatoes
- 140g tomato puree
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning (mix of oregano, marjoram, thyme, basil, parsley and rosemary)
- 1/2 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 tsp red-wine vinegar
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Ingredients (Pickles and Fennel Sausage)
- [Cured Chicago thin-crust pizza dough](../bread/chicago-thin-crust.md).
- Pecorino Romano (or Parmigiano Reggiano)
- Mozzarella (preferably low-moisture)
- Fennel sausage
- Pickled vegetables (ideally giardiniera)

## Ingredients (Chorizo, Jalapenos and Honey)
- [Cured Chicago thin-crust pizza dough](../bread/chicago-thin-crust.md).
- Pecorino Romano (or Parmigiano Reggiano)
- Mozzarella (preferably low-moisture)
- Sliced Jalapenos from the jar
- Spicy chorizo
- Honey (for topping after baking)

## Instructions
1. At least 45 minutes before baking, set a baking steel on an oven rack in the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 250C.

2. Make the sauce: Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor, and pulse until mostly smooth but a few small bits of tomato remain. 
   Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

3. When the oven is heated and you’re ready to bake, dust a pizza peel with semolina or cornmeal. 
   Lift cured pizza skin with the parchment paper still attached. 
   The top (exposed) side will be drier than the underside. 
   Place the pizza skin on the peel with the drier side facing down (so the papered side faces up). 
   Peel off the parchment paper paper and discard. 
   Using a fork, poke the crust all over to prevent large bubbles from forming.

4. Spread the sauce evenly over the entire surface of the pizza, all the way to the edges. 
   Sprinkle with Romano or Parmesan. 
   Spread the mozzarella evenly over the entire surface, spreading it all the way to the edges. 
   
5. Add additional toppings of your choosing all over the pizza in little bits, such as sausage or pickles.

6. Give the pizza peel a few shakes to make sure the pizza is still loose, then transfer the pizza to the heated baking steel or stone. 
   Bake until the pizza is as done as you like it, around 10 minutes. 
   You can use a metal pizza peel to lift the edges of the pizza and peek underneath as it bakes to ensure the bottom is done to your liking.

7. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and sprinkle immediately with the more Romano or Parmesan. 
   Allow to rest for 3 minutes, cut into squares, and serve immediately. 
   Let the oven reheat for at least 10 minutes before baking subsequent pizzas.

## Notes
- This style of pizza works best with minimal toppings–two to three items max. Sausage and giardiniera is a classic combination in the Chicago area.
- If you can only get fresh mozzarella, tear it into chunks and dry it out in the fridge first.
