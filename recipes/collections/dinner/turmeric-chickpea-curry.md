Serves: 4.

## Ingredients
- 800g canned chickpeas
- 600g spinach
- thumb-sized piece of ginger
- 5 yellow onions
- 8 garlic cloves
- 15g mint
- 20g turmeric
- 800ml coconut milk
- chili flakes
- cumin seeds
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 300g rice
- 2 naan breads
- 100g greek yoghurt

## Instructions
1. Slice onions in rings. Salt and fry slowly for 12 minutes until deeply browned. Deglaze with a splash of water if the bottom begins to burn.

2. Add crushed garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant. 

3. Drain and add the chickpeas, together with a huge amount of turmeric (I use about half my spice container, which is ridiculous), chili flakes and cumin seeds. Turn gas up to high and fry until the chickpeas brown up.

4. Turn off the heat and thoroughly mash the chickpeas. Add the coconut milk, spinach and stock cube. Cover and leave to simmer for 40 mins. If after this time the sauce is still very thin, uncover and simmer for a bit longer.

5. A few minutes before serving, stir in mint leaves.

6. Serve with cooked rice, naan and yoghurt.
