## Instructions
1. Heat the olive oil in a casserole. 
   Peel and finely chop the onion and dice the carrots, adding both to the casserole as you go. 
   Sauté until the onion is translucent (8-10 minutes), then finely grate or crush in the garlic and continue cooking until aromatic.

2. Stir in the cumin, mint, pepper and pul biber, followed by the tomato and pepper paste and cook for a minute more.
   Wash the lentils under the running tab, then add them to the casserole along with the salt and 900ml of water. 
   Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer covered for 20 minutes or until the lentils are tender. 
   Meanwhile, trim and discard the lower stems of the parsley, finely chop the rest and set aside for later.

3. Turn off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and divide over bowls.

4. For the chili oil, heat the olive oil in a small pan over low heat and add the pul biber. 
   Allow it to infuse the oil for around a minute, then drizzle it over the soup, garnish with the chopped parsley and serve.
