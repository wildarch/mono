Serves: 6

## Ingredients
- 1 leek
- 2 spring onions
- 600g spinach
- 15g dill
- 200g feta
- 3 eggs
- 50g butter
- 14 butter puff pastry sheets
- 1 tbsp panko
- tsp nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Slice the leek and spring onion (trim off the green bits).
   Roughly chop the spinach.

2. Fry the leek and spring onion in a bit of olive oil until turning translucent, about 4 minutes.
   
3. Add the spinach bit by bit, cooking until most of the moisture evaporates, 6 minutes.
   Turn off the heat, leave to cool down ~15 minutes.

4. Finely chop the dill and crumble the feta.
   Beat the eggs, then add the dill, feta and vegetables (wait until the vegetables have cooled, or the eggs will curdle).
   Add the nutmeg and season with salt to taste.

5. Preheat the oven to 180 Â°C.

6. Grease up a baking dish, then clad it with 8 of the pastry sheets.
   Save the remaining sheets to create a lid.

7. Poke holes in the base with a fork and sprinkle over the panko.
   Fill the pie with the spinach mixture, and seal it with the lid.

8. Bake the spanokopita for 1 hour until golden brown.
   Leave to cool down 10 minutes before serving.
