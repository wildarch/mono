## Ingredients
### Base
- 250g strong white bread flour
- 5g salt
- 150ml water
- 50ml neutral oil

### Classic Topping
Enough for half of the base recipe:
- 100g lardons
- 1 onion
- 100g creme fraiche
- nutmeg

## Instructions
1. Place a baking steel in the oven, and preheat it to 250C.
   Do this preferably one hour before baking to ensure the baking steel is fully up to temperature.

1. Make the base: To a bowl, add 150ml water, 50ml of oil and 5g of salt.
   Whisk to combine.
   Add 250g of flour, and mix until there is no dry flour left.
   Cover and leave to autolyse for 30 minutes.

2. Tip the dough out onto the table and knead it for 5-6 minutes.
   The dough may be sticky, so flour your working surface and hands.
   Cover the dough again, and leave it to rest *in the fridge* for another 30 minutes. 

3. Make the topping. 
   For the classic topping, slice the onions as finely as possible.
   Fry the lardons in a little butter or oil until the fat begins to render, 
   then scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside, 
   keeping as much fat in the pan as possible. 
   Turn down the heat and fry the onions with a pinch of salt until soft and golden, but not browned.
   Kill the heat, then stir in the creme fraiche and nutmeg to taste.

4. Roll out the base onto parchment paper.
   Make it as thin as possible.
   Spread the topping over the base.
   Bake for 12 minutes, or until charred in spots.
